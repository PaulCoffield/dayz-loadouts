# DayZ Loadouts - variations for spawning with better kit

Some loadouts from [Bohemia Interactive](https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive) others from [Scalespeeder](https://github.com/scalespeeder).

I decided to tweak/create some of my own based on these. 

They should work if you know how to upload and add the XML files to your server - though I take no responsibility for them and any impact they may have should you choose to use them yourself.

Using these modded xml files could break the functioning of your DAYZ server, requiring a reinstall that would wipe
all player progress.

Using these modded xml files neccessitates increased regular restarts to prevent server crashing.

It is suggested you thoroughly test your server after applying these files to ensure proper
functioning of your server.

To install these files simply reset your XMLS to default, then upload these over the top of your existing files and restart your server.
